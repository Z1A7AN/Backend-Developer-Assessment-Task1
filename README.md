# Backend-Developer-Assessment---Task-1
 This project provides a comprehensive implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in Node.js using Express. Divided into two parts, it covers the fundamental aspects of JWT authentication and extends to include refresh token functionality for enhanced security and session management.

Part one focuses on the basics, including token creation, transmission, and verification, enabling secure user authentication for accessing protected routes. It demonstrates how to issue JWT tokens to users upon login, ensuring only authorized users can access specific resources.

Part two delves into advanced features by introducing refresh tokens. These tokens allow for automatic token refreshment, bolstering security by mitigating the risks associated with long-lived access tokens. Additionally, the project showcases how to implement token revocation, enabling administrators to invalidate tokens and revoke user privileges as needed.

Key Features:

Simplified JWT authentication implementation in Node.js and Express.
Two-part tutorial covering basic JWT authentication and advanced refresh token functionality.
Secure token generation, transmission, and verification for user authentication.
Integration of refresh tokens for automatic token renewal and enhanced security.
Token revocation mechanism for invalidating tokens and managing user access privileges.
